Name:                diagrams
Version:             0.6
Synopsis:            Embedded domain-specific language for declarative vector graphics
Description:         Diagrams is a full-featured framework and embedded domain-specific langauge for creating
                     declarative vector graphics and animations.
                     .
                     This package is just a convenient wrapper
                     around the @diagrams-core@, @diagrams-lib@ and
                     @diagrams-contrib@ packages, so they can be
                     installed with a single `cabal install diagrams`
                     command.
                     .
                     The package also comes with flags to enable two
                     different backends.
                     A Haskell-native SVG
                     backend (the @diagrams-svg@ package)
                     can be selected with @-fsvg@. This
                     flag is enabled by default, so if you do /not/
                     want the SVG backend, you must explicitly
                     disable it with @-f-svg@.  The SVG backend does not
                     yet quite support all the features of the cairo
                     backend: text alignment and embedded images are
                     the two main missing features at this point, and
                     of course it can only produce SVG images. It is,
                     however, much easier to install, so it is the
                     out-of-the-box default.
                     .
		     There is also a cairo backend (the
                     @diagrams-cairo@ package) which can be selected
                     with the @-fcairo@ flag. It is fully-featured and
                     can produce PNG, PS, PDF, or SVG output; however,
                     due to its dependencies it can be difficult to
                     install on some platforms (notably OS X).
